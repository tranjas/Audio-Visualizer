## Audio Visualizer Implementation in SystemVerilog
# Overview
This document outlines the implementation of an Audio Visualizer in SystemVerilog. The visualizer will analyze an audio input and display it as a graphical representation on a VGA monitor. To achieve this, we will utilize an Audio Driver to capture audio signals and a VGA Driver to display the visualizations.

# Components
The implementation involves the following components:

Audio Driver: The Audio Driver is responsible for capturing audio signals from an external audio source, such as a microphone or audio input port. It converts analog audio signals into digital data that can be processed by the visualizer.

FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Module: The FFT module takes the digital audio data from the Audio Driver and performs frequency analysis on it. It transforms the time-domain audio data into the frequency domain, providing information about different frequency components.

Audio Visualizer Logic: This module processes the output of the FFT module and generates graphical visualizations based on the audio frequencies. It may use techniques like amplitude mapping, color gradients, and bar graphs to display the audio spectrum.

VGA Driver: The VGA Driver controls the VGA output to display the visualizations on a connected VGA monitor. It generates the appropriate VGA signals (horizontal sync, vertical sync, RGB signals) to render the visualizations.

Top-Level Module: The Top-Level module integrates all the components and connects them appropriately.

# Hardware Implementation
Connect an external audio source (microphone, audio input port) to the Audio Driver for audio signal capture.

Connect a VGA monitor to the FPGA board for visual output.

Instantiate the Audio Driver, FFT module, Audio Visualizer Logic, and VGA Driver in the Top-Level module.

Connect the modules and their respective input/output ports in the Top-Level module.

# Development Flow
Design and implement each SystemVerilog module according to the specified logic.

Simulate each module using a SystemVerilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim) to verify their correctness.

Create a testbench for the Top-Level module to verify the interaction between the modules and their functionality as a complete audio visualizer.

Synthesize the design to obtain a bitstream suitable for the target FPGA device.

Upload the bitstream to the FPGA board and test the audio visualizer on a VGA monitor with an audio input source.

# Additional Features
To enhance the audio visualizer, you can consider adding the following features:

Visualization Effects: Implement various visualization effects, such as spectrum analyzers, waveforms, and animations.

User Interface: Add user controls to adjust the visualizer settings, such as sensitivity, colors, and display modes.

Audio Input Selection: Allow users to switch between different audio input sources for visualization.
